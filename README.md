# SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL FOR *SCIENTIFIC REPORTS* PUBLICATION

This repository is created in response to editor request for manuscript submission for the journal *Scientific Reports*

## PUBLICATION TITLE:

*Novel methods to Identify Suicide Ideation and Suicidal Attempts in a Psychiatric Clinical Research Database using Natural Language Processing*


## SCIENTIFIC REPORT EDITOR REQUEST

"Could you upload all the scripts used to clean your data and generate your results to a repository such as GitHub?"


## AUTHOR RESPONSE

This repository contains scripts used to clean data and generate results.

## CONTENTS OF THIS REPOSITORY

This GitHub repository has the following code and documents uploaded:

**To generate the rules-based NLP algorithm to identify instances of suicide ideation the following GATE application was developed:**

-	application-resources.zip

**To generate the machine learning NLP algorithm to identify instances of suicide attempts the following application was used:**

- TextHunter. Any "behind-the-scenes" algorithms developed can be requested and provided with permission from CRIS de-identification oversight committee. 


**To clean data from machine learning algorithm identifying Suicide Attempt the following code was used:** 

-	Post_Processing_code: SQL code for post-processing the machine learning algorithm identifying suicide attempts.


**For details on how suicide ideation and suicide attempt were defined and manually annotated, for inter-rater agreement figures and for terms used to filter documents mentioning suicide attempt the following document is provided.**
